### HTML + CSS Review

**Exercises**
<ul>
  <li>Warm up:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Using your practice HTML file from before, add CSS styles to it such you change the:
        <ul>
          <li>color</li>
         <li>font-family</li>
          <li>font-size</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    <li>On your own, look up how to do the following in CSS, and add it to your HTML file as well:
      <ul>
        <li>underline text</li>
        <li>bold text</li>
        <li>italicize text</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>HTML exercise: Copy and paste <a href="https://codepen.io/sisiwei/pen/KzLezJ?editors=1000">the code on this page</a> into a file called `supreme-court.html` on your computer and follow the instructions inside to format the page.</li>
  <li>CSS exercise: Now that your Supreme Court article has HTML, make a new `style.css` file, link it up to your HTML, and try to do the following:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Make the main headline dark red.</li>
      <li>Use the font family "Georgia" for the main headline and the subheadline.</li>
      <li>Center the text of the main headline and the subheadline.</li>
      <li>Give the paragraphs a line height of 19 pixels.</li>
      <li>Remove the underline from the links.</li>
      <li>Make the "Related articles" label all uppercase.</li>
      <li>Bonus: Make an underline appear when you hover over a link.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>How to write your own CSS Class</li>
  <li>How CSS deals with conflict</li>
</ul>

### Optional Homework (It's a challenge!)

Only for those of you who have time and are looking for an extra challenge. This is 100% optional because we will not be talking about this in class tomorrow. Instead, if you do it, I'll give you an individual response via email or Slack.
<ul>
  <li>Save <a href="https://codepen.io/sisiwei/pen/bpXwMB?editors=1000">this HTML</a> onto your computer. Link to a new CSS file that you create. Write CSS to make the end result look like <a href="http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/images/data-institute/presentations/mars.jpg">this image</a>. You may only write CSS. You cannot edit the HTML file. When you're done, send me your files or send me the links of your files on Github and I'll give you feedback on how it went!</li>
</ul>

### Scraping and tracking without code

**In-Class Demos**
